<h3 class="hP docDisplay">SECURE Act Changes</h3>
<p class="hP">The Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019 (SECURE Act) (P.L. 116-94) changed the<span> </span><span class="docSearchTerm osa-doc-search-term">RMD</span><span> </span>rules for employees and IRA owners who died after December 31, 2019. Under<span> </span><a class="link osa-rsi-citation">Code Sec. 401(a)(9)(H)(i)</a>, if an employee in a defined contribution plan or IRA owner has a designated beneficiary, the 5-year distribution period has been lengthened to 10 years, and the 10-year rule applies regardless of whether the employee dies before the required beginning date. Proposed regulations would interpret the 10-year rule to require the beneficiary of an employee who died after his required beginning date to continue to take an annual<span> </span><span class="docSearchTerm">RMD</span><span> </span>beginning in the first calendar year after the employee’s death. This aspect of the 10-year rule differs from the 5-year rule, which required no<span> </span><span class="docSearchTerm">RMD</span><span> </span>until the end of the 5-year period.

<p class="hP">Comprehensive coverage is health insurance which is subject to certain federal consumer protections. Both<span> </span><span class="docSearchTerm osa-doc-search-term">STLDI</span><span> </span>and fixed indemnity excepted benefits coverage generally provide limited benefits at lower premiums than comprehensive coverage, and enrollment is typically available at any time rather than being restricted to open and special enrollment periods. However, the government is concerned about the financial and health risks that consumers face if they use either form of coverage as a substitute for comprehensive coverage, particularly as a long-term substitute. Consumers who do not understand key differences between<span> </span><span class="docSearchTerm">STLDI</span>, fixed indemnity excepted benefits coverage, and comprehensive coverage may unknowingly take on significant financial and health risks if they purchase<span> </span><span class="docSearchTerm">STLDI</span><span> </span>or fixed indemnity excepted benefits coverage under the misunderstanding that such products provide comprehensive coverage.</p>

<p class="hP"><span class="docSearchTerm osa-doc-search-term">STLDI</span><span> </span>is a type of health insurance coverage sold by health insurance issuers that is primarily designed to fill temporary gaps in coverage that may occur when an individual is transitioning from one plan or coverage to another (for example, due to application of a waiting period for employer coverage). Because<span> </span><span class="docSearchTerm">STLDI</span><span> </span>falls outside of<span> </span><span class="quote">"individual health insurance coverage,"</span><span> </span>it is generally exempt from the Federal individual market consumer protections and requirements for comprehensive coverage. This can be an issue because individuals who enroll in<span> </span><span class="docSearchTerm">STLDI</span><span> </span>are often not aware that they will not be guaranteed these key consumer protections.</p>

For purposes of this<span> </span><span class="docSearchTerm">definition</span>, a renewal or extension includes the term of a new<span> </span><span class="docSearchTerm">STLDI</span><span> </span>policy, certificate, or contract of insurance issued by the same issuer to the same policyholder within the 12-month period beginning on the original effective date of the initial policy, certificate, or contract of insurance.</p>
<p class="hP"><span class="docSearchTerm osa-doc-search-term">STLDI</span><span> </span>issuers must display a notice on the first page (in either paper or electronic form, including on a website) of the policy, certificate, or contract of insurance, and in any marketing, application, and enrollment materials (including reenrollment materials) provided to individuals at or before the time an individual has the opportunity to enroll or reenroll in the coverage, in at least 14-point font. A sample notice has been provided by the agencies.</p>
<h3 class="hP docDisplay">Fixed Indemnity Insurance</h3>
<p class="hP">Federal consumer protections and requirements for comprehensive coverage do not apply to any individual coverage or any group health plan in relation to its provision of certain types of benefits, known as<span> </span><span class="quote">"excepted benefits."</span><span> </span>Like other forms of excepted benefits, fixed indemnity excepted benefits coverage does not provide comprehensive coverage. Rather, its primary purpose is to provide income replacement benefits. Benefits under this type of coverage are paid in a fixed cash amount following the occurrence of a health-related event, such as a period of hospitalization or illness. In addition, benefits are provided at a pre-determined level regardless of any health care costs incurred by a covered individual with respect to the health-related event. Although a benefit payment may equal all or a portion of the cost of care related to an event, it is not necessarily designed to do so, and the benefit payment is made without regard to the amount of health care costs incurred.</p>
<p class="hP">In an effort to give consumers an informed choice, the<span> </span><span class="docSearchTerm osa-doc-search-term">final</span><span> </span><span class="docSearchTerm">rules</span><span> </span>adopt the requirement of a consumer notice that must be provided when offering fixed indemnity excepted benefits coverage in the group market and update the existing notice for such coverage offered in the individual market. The<span> </span><span class="docSearchTerm">final</span><span> </span><span class="docSearchTerm">rule</span><span> </span>does not address any other provision of the 2023 proposed<span> </span><span class="docSearchTerm">rules</span><span> </span>(NPRM REG-120730-21) relating to fixed indemnity excepted benefits coverage.</p>
