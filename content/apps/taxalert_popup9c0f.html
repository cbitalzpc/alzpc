Promoters have been peddling elaborate<span>&nbsp;</span><span class="docSearchTerm">bogus</span><span>&nbsp;</span>schemes to reduce taxes and make handsome profits. Fraudulent schemes can threatening taxpayers can include exploitative agreements related to syndicated conservation easements and micro-captive insurance arrangements. Some of these schemes even have an international aspect such as concealing money and digital-assets in foreign accounts.<span>&nbsp;</span><span class="quote">"Taxpayers should be wary of anything that seeks to completely eliminate a legitimate tax responsibility,"</span><span>&nbsp;</span>said<span>&nbsp;</span><span class="docSearchTerm">IRS</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Commissioner Danny Werfel.</p><p class="hP">Generally, taxpayers can claim a charitable contribution deduction for the fair market value of a conservation easement transferred to a charity if the transfer meets the requirements under<span>&nbsp;</span><a class="link osa-rsi-citation" rel="nofollow" data-query="IRC-FILE S170" data-jsfn="callCitationLink">Code Sec. 170</a>.

Similarly, micro-captives involve schemes that lack many of the requisite attributes of a legitimate insurance. While many of these schemes are promoted and advertised online, the one thing in common to all are that they promise tax savings that are<span>&nbsp;</span><span class="quote">"too good to be true"</span><span>&nbsp;</span>and will likely cause legal harm to taxpayers who use them. The<span>&nbsp;</span><span class="docSearchTerm">IRS</span><span>&nbsp;</span>warned taxpayers that the agency remains vigilant of these attempts to game the system.
