<div class="news_description"><p>Enacted as part of New York's 2024-25 budget package, A.B. 8808 creates sales and use tax exemptions for residential energy storage systems and revises insurance tax provisions concerning the life insurance guaranty credit.</p><p>Exemptions for residential energy storage systems. A sales and use tax exemption is enacted for residential energy storage systems equipment and the service of installing such systems. "Residential energy storage systems equipment" means an arrangement or combination of components installed in a residence that stores electricity for use at a later time to provide heating, cooling, hot water and/or electricity.</p><p>In addition, a sales and use tax exemption is enacted for receipts from the sale of electricity by a person primarily engaged in the sale of energy storage system equipment and/or electricity generated by such equipment pursuant to a written agreement under which such electricity is generated by residential energy system storage equipment that is:</p><p>owned by a person other than the purchaser of such electricity;</p><p>installed on residential property of the purchaser of such electricity; and</p><p>used to provide heating, cooling, hot water or electricity.</p><p>These exemptions are effective June 1, 2024, and expire June 1, 2026.</p><p>Life insurance guaranty credit. The law is amended to ensure that assessments for not-for-profit member insurers of the Life and Health Insurance Company Guaranty Corporation of New York are comparable to the assessments for for-profit member insurers, taking into account applicable tax credits. Amendments also modernize the calculation of the insurance franchise tax credit applied to for-profit insurers. The changes apply to taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2024. Ch. 58 (A.B. 8808), Laws 2024, effective April 20, 2024, or as noted</p></div>
